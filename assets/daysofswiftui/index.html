            <p> Welcome to 100 days of SwiftUI 
                project. This project is running 
                on my Instagram account. My goal 
                is the daily uploading of code
                snippets for 100 days which differ 
                in both their content and their difficulty 
                with Swift programming language using SwiftUI 
                framework.
